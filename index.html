        <div class="about-content">
            
            <p>
                The inspiration behind creating my portfolio website stems from a desire to showcase my skills and projects in a way that reflects my growth as a developer. As I progressed through my studies, I realized the importance of having an online presence—a space where I could display my work, share my learning process, and connect with others in the tech community.
                It is is more than just a requirement for the <a class = "school-link" href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/" target="_blank"> Holberton School</a> project; it's a personal milestone. It allows me to present my projects visually and interactively, highlighting both technical skills and creativity. This process has also given me hands-on experience with web development tools and technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a better understanding of how to build responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
                Additionally, by creating a portfolio website, I hope to bridge the gap between my academic experience and the professional world. It serves as a foundation for my future career, giving potential employers or collaborators a chance to see the work I am passionate about. Ultimately, the project reflects my journey in tech and my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.<br><br>

            <p>This is the home page of my portfolio website. It has a brief description of myself and what I do. I have also added few animations to add to it's interactivity and make it more appealing to the user/visitors.<br>In addition, I have added icons linking to my social media profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter), providing users with alternative ways to connect with me. Also there is a link to my CV where I have layed out my skills and projects.</p>

            <p>In this section, is where i have listed my coding and professional skills. For each skill, I incorporated a progress bar to visually indicate my proficiency level. The progress bars offer an intuitive way for visitors to gauge my expertise in a glance.<br>The length of each progress bar corresponds to a percentage, representing my confidence or experience with the skill.<br>The combination of the column structure and progress bars keeps the design minimal yet functional, making the section aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand.</p>

            <p>The section begins with a bold heading inviting users to get in touch with me.<br>I've included a contact form with fields for the user’s name, email, subject, and message. The form is minimalistic but functional, ensuring it’s easy to fill out.<br>Each input field is clearly labeled to guide the user, and I have implemented basic form validation to ensure the correct information is submitted.<br></p>
